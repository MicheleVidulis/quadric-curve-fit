# quadric-curve-fit
Python project for 3d quadric curve fitting

The program fits a quadric equation to a set of 3d points using least-squares. The project also includes some examples.

A common application for this is in the calibration of 3 axis magnetometers. Magnetometer readings are logged and an Ellipsoid is fit to the points. A transformation matrix is then calculated to move the points on to a sphere.
